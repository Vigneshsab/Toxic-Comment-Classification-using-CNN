This model could be used to easily identify the most toxic comments and remove them or hide them from younger people. In today's world people of every age are using social media. There are many young users as well. But very young users don't understand the meaning of these toxic comments and try to learn the meaning of them. These comments could be hided in the comments section for those particular users.
